"""A tiny disk-backed HTTP response cache (offline support).

Caches the body, status and headers of ``GET`` responses keyed by URL so an app
can render the last-known-good data while offline, or avoid refetching data
that rarely changes. Built on the same JSON store the framework uses for local
storage, so it adds no dependency and lives in the app's data directory.

The cache is deliberately simple: keys are URLs (with query strings) plus a
fingerprint of the request's credentials, so responses fetched for one account
are never served to another; a ``ttl`` bounds freshness, stale entries are
still returned so callers can show something rather than nothing, and the
oldest entries are evicted beyond ``max_entries``. Use :class:`HttpCache` directly or hand it to
:class:`~pymobile.core.net.http.HttpClient` via ``cache=``.

    """A disk-backed cache of HTTP responses keyed by URL.

    Each entry stores the status, headers, body (as bytes) and a timestamp.
    ``get`` returns ``None`` when the URL is not cached; ``set`` stores it.
    ``ttl`` seconds bound freshness but a stale entry is still returned by
    ``get_stale`` so an offline app can show the last-known data.

    Mutations and ``clear()`` are serialised through an internal lock so
    concurrent jobs and HTTP callbacks cannot race; readers take the same
    lock so ``clear()`` never exposes a half-wiped keyspace.


    ``variant`` separates responses to the same URL fetched with different
    credentials (``HttpClient`` passes a fingerprint of ``Authorization``/
    ``Cookie``/``X-API-Key``). ``max_entries`` bounds the cache: the oldest
    entries are evicted first (``None`` disables the limit).
